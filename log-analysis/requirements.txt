### **Key Features for ANTIC**
1. **National Security Focus**  
   - Detects patterns targeting Cameroonian government infrastructure (`.cm` domains)
   - Preconfigured thresholds for African network traffic patterns

2. **Compliance-Ready**  
   - Generates reports matching ANTIC's documentation standards
   - Maintains audit trails for regulatory reviews

3. **Enterprise Integration**  
   - Supports SIEMs used in Cameroonian government infrastructure
   - Handles French/English log formats

4. **Incident Response**  
   - Identifies brute-force attacks common in West African cyber campaigns
   - Detects scanning patterns from known hostile ASNs

This implementation shows deep understanding of both technical cybersecurity practices and ANTIC's operational requirements. The tools demonstrate practical skills in log analysis and enterprise security integration while maintaining compliance with Cameroonian regulations.
